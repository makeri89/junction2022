We stand here on the precipice of future. There lay many a problem ahead as the material reality of humankind trends ever towards the stars. If we pass these problems for our progeny, it will already be too late. The building blocks of tomorrow must be laid today.

We are not so conceited to think that we can solve all those problems, but every mighty oak must come from a fledgling sapling. Our idea: UNIVERSUM INCOME 3000. It does some cryptomagic and voila, interstellar civilization.

Thank you and we'll see you out there.
